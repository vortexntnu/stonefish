# ***Stonefish***
### An advanced simulation tool developed for marine robotics.

Stonefish is a C++ library combining a physics engine and a lightweight rendering pipeline. The physics engine is based on the core functionality of the [Bullet Physics](https://pybullet.org) library, extended to deliver realistic simulation of marine robots. It is directed towards researchers in the field of marine robotics but can as well be used as a general purpose robot simulator. 

Stonefish includes advanced hydrodynamic computations based on actual geometry of bodies, to better approximate hydrodynamic forces and allow for effects not possible when using symbolic models. The rendering pipeline, developed from the ground up, delivers realistic rendering of atmosphere, ocean and underwater environment. Special focus was put on the latter, where effects of wavelength-dependent light absorption and scattering were considered (other simulators often use only blue fog). 

Stonefish can be used to create standalone applications or combined with a [Robot Operating System](https://www.ros.org) (ROS) package [_stonefish_ros_](https://github.com/patrykcieslak/stonefish_ros), which implements 
standard simulator node and facilitates easy integration with ROS architecture.

There are two sources of documentation for the library: [html documentation generated with Sphinx](https://stonefish.readthedocs.io) and code documentation generated with Doxygen, based on comments in the code (instructions below).

### Requirements

The simulation is CPU heavy and requires a recent GPU. The minimum requirement is the support for *OpenGL 4.3*. 

Install official manufacturer drivers for your graphics card before using _Stonefish_!

The software is developed and tested on *Linux Ubuntu*. It should work on any Unix based platform. A version for Windows is not available at this time. MacOS is not supported due to its lack of support for OpenGL 4.3.

### Installation
1. Dependencies
    * **OpenGL Mathematics library** (libglm-dev, version >= 0.9.9.0)
    * **SDL2 library** (libsdl2-dev)
    * **Freetype library** (libfreetype6-dev)

2. Building
    1. Clone _stonefish_ repository.
    2. `cd stonefish`
    3. `mkdir build`
    4. `cd build`
    5. `cmake ..`
    6. `make -jX` (where X is the number of threads)
    8. `sudo make install`

3. Documentation
    1. Go to "stonefish" directory.
    2. `doxygen doxygen`
    3. Open "docs/html/index.html".
